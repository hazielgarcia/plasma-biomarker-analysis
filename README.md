# plasma-biomarker-analysis
## Project Summary
This project aims to predict amyloid-β plaque positivity using plasma biomarker data from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention [(WRAP)](https://wrap.wisc.edu). The primary goals are to evaluate the feasibility of predicting amyloid PET status through plasma biomarkers, identify which biomarkers most accurately predict amyloid concentration, and assess the impact of demographic factors on these predictions.
